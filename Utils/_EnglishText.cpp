**                                  IMPORTANT TRANSLATION NOTES                                     **
******************************************************************************************************

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Always be aware that foreign strings should be of equal or shorter length than the English equivalent.
	I know that this is difficult to do on many occasions due to the nature of foreign languages when
	compared to English.  By doing so, this will greatly reduce the amount of work on both sides.  In
	most cases (but not all), JA2 interfaces were designed with just enough space to fit the English word.
	The general rule is if the string is very short (less than 10 characters), then it's short because of
	interface limitations.  On the other hand, full sentences commonly have little limitations for length.
	Strings in between are a little dicey.
- Never translate a string to appear on multiple lines.  All strings L"This is a really long string...",
	must fit on a single line no matter how long the string is.  All strings start with L" and end with ",
- Never remove any extra spaces in strings.  In addition, all strings containing multiple sentences only
	have one space after a period, which is different than standard typing convention.  Never modify sections
	of strings contain combinations of % characters.  These are special format characters and are always
	used in conjunction with other characters.  For example, %s means string, and is commonly used for names,
	locations, items, etc.  %d is used for numbers.  %c%d is a character and a number (such as A9).
	%% is how a single % character is built.  There are countless types, but strings containing these
	special characters are usually commented to explain what they mean.  If it isn't commented, then
	if you can't figure out the context, then feel free to ask SirTech.
- Comments are always started with // Anything following these two characters on the same line are
	considered to be comments.  Do not translate comments.  Comments are always applied to the following
	string(s) on the next line(s), unless the comment is on the same line as a string.
- All new comments made by SirTech will use "//@@@ comment" (without the quotes) notation.  By searching
	for @@@ everytime you recieve a new version, it will simplify your task and identify special instructions.
  Commonly, these types of comments will be used to ask you to abbreviate a string.  Please leave the
	comments intact, and SirTech will remove them once the translation for that particular area is resolved.
- If you have a problem or question with translating certain strings, please use "//!!! comment"
	(without the quotes).  The syntax is important, and should be identical to the comments used with @@@
	symbols.  SirTech will search for !!! to look for your problems and questions.  This is a more
	efficient method than detailing questions in email, so try to do this whenever possible.



FAST HELP TEXT -- Explains how the syntax of fast help text works.
**************

1) BOLDED LETTERS
	The popup help text system supports special characters to specify the hot key(s) for a button.
	Anytime you see a '|' symbol within the help text string, that means the following key is assigned
	to activate the action which is usually a button.

	EX:  L"|Map Screen"

	This means the 'M' is the hotkey.  In the game, when somebody hits the 'M' key, it activates that
	button.  When translating the text to another language, it is best to attempt to choose a word that
	uses 'M'.  If you can't always find a match, then the best thing to do is append the 'M' at the end
	of the string in this format:

	EX:  L"Ecran De Carte (|M)"  (this is the French translation)

	Other examples are used multiple times, like the Esc key  or "|E|s|c" or Space -> (|S|p|a|c|e)

2) NEWLINE
  Any place you see a \n within the string, you are looking at another string that is part of the fast help
	text system.  \n notation doesn't need to be precisely placed within that string, but whereever you wish
	to start a new line.

	EX:  L"Clears all the mercs' positions,\nand allows you to re-enter them manually."

	Would appear as:

				Clears all the mercs' positions,
				and allows you to re-enter them manually.

	NOTE:  It is important that you don't pad the characters adjacent to the \n with spaces.  If we did this
	       in the above example, we would see

	WRONG WAY -- spaces before and after the \n
	EX:  L"Clears all the mercs' positions, \n and allows you to re-enter them manually."

	Would appear as: (the second line is moved in a character)

				Clears all the mercs' positions,
 				 and allows you to re-enter them manually.


@@@ NOTATION
************

	Throughout the text files, you'll find an assortment of comments.  Comments are used to describe the
	text to make translation easier, but comments don't need to be translated.  A good thing is to search for
	"@@@" after receiving new version of the text file, and address the special notes in this manner.

!!! NOTATION
************

	As described above, the "!!!" notation should be used by you to ask questions and address problems as
	SirTech uses the "@@@" notation.

{
	L"Use the options here to enable some of 1.13's many features. If enabled, the toggle boxes here will take precedence over some booleans in JA2_Options.ini. If disabled, these boxes will have no effect.",
	L"New Chance to Hit (NCTH) is a complete overhaul of the vanilla chance-to-hit system. Compared to the vanilla system, it takes into account more variables when determining the trajectory of a fired bullet.",
	L"This controls whether enemies drop all of their items when they are killed. If enabled, everything is dropped. Otherwise, regular drop chances are used.",
	L"This controls whether enemies drop all of their items when they are killed. If enabled, everything is dropped, and the drop chances are used to determine whether an item is severely damaged.",
	L"Suppression Fire is a way of controlling a battlefield. When under heavy fire, a character accumulates suppression, causing AP loss. In addition to AP loss, Suppression SHOCK can also be accumulated, which makes the character less useful - both Chance-to-Hit and chance to be hit are reduced. Characters can go into negative APs when under suppression fire, losing APs off their NEXT turn. Use suppression fire to prevent enemies from approaching, pin them down, and then advance and kill them while they are hiding. Note that they will try to do the same thing to you!",
	L"When you first capture Drassen, the Queen actually follows through on her command to retake Drassen. This will make holding Drassen VERY difficult in the early game and enabling this option is not recommended for new players!",
	L"Similar to the Drassen Counterattack, other cities can be subjected to massive counterattacks by the Queen after you capture them.",
	L"If City Counterattacks still aren't enough for you, try enabling this! Not only will the Queen send counterattacks, but she may also try to retake multiple cities at the same time.",
	L"You can acquire and spend Intel, a resource closely tied to espionage and information brokering. Intel can be gained by spies, interrogating prisoners, and other ways. It can then be spent at a black market for rare weapons, or at the Recon Intelligence Services website for enemy info.",
	L"Allows you to take prisoners, which can be done by demanding their surrender in combat, or by handcuffing incapacitated soldiers. Once captured, they can be sent to a prison you own and interrogated, which can result in money, intel, or their defection to your militia.",
	L"You will need to invest a little bit in a mine before you can reap its full benefits. Workers are trained like militia, costing time and money. Note that losing control of a sector may cause worker loss!",
	L"Enemy groups have a chance to ambush your squad. If your squad is ambushed, they will be placed in the centre of the map with the enemy group encircling them.",
	L"The queen can now send out assassins. These are elite soldiers that are covert ops experts. They will disguise as members of your militia, and, when the time is right, they will suddenly attack your mercs. New trait system required and new inventory system recommended.",
	L"A variety of enemy types can appear in enemy groups, increasing their overall effectiveness. A small icon will appear next to an enemy who has been observed to have a role. Roles include weapon and equipment specialists, and soldiers carrying keys or keycards.",
	L"Requires the Enemy Roles feature to be enabled. Enemy medics can bandage their wounded comrades and perform field surgery on them.",
	L"Requires the Enemy Roles feature to be enabled. Enemy lieutenants and captains provide sector-wide bonuses for their squad.",
	L"Requires the Enemy Roles feature to be enabled. Generals provide strategic bonuses to the enemy army and may be present in enemy-controlled towns. As high-value targets, they are protected by a small retinue of bodyguards and may flee when they sense danger.",
	L"Some time after you have trained militia, Kerberus will offer its services to you. On their website, you can order security personnel from them, which will act as militia. They require a high down payment but require no training time.",
	L"Your team needs food and water to survive. Without them, they will starve and suffer severe penalties. Keep an eye on the quality of food you're consuming!",
	L"It is possible for your team to catch illnesses from a variety of sources: open wounds, corpses, swamp insects, etc. A disease will give certain mali, and in extreme cases, cause death. Most diseases can be treated by doctors or medicines, and there are items that can provide protection.",
	L"Mercs can form dynamic opinions of each other from a variety of events. These opinion events directly influence a merc's morale and can be both positive and negative. While an opinion event can occur once per day, the impact of one of these events can last for a few days, so it's possible for events to compound over this time period.",
	L"This is an add-on to the Dynamic Opinions feature. This feature allows mercs to talk to each other whenever an opinion event occurs. These dialogue choices may have further impacts on how mercs see each other. If an IMP merc takes part in this, you have a brief window to choose how that character responds.",
	L"The Arulco Special Division is responsible for ordering and deploying mechanised units to the Arulcan army. It uses income gained from mines to purchase vehicles for use against you.",
	L"Requires the Arulco Strategic Division feature to be enabled. At a certain point in your campaign, the ASD can start using helicopters to deploy small squads of elite soldiers to harass you.",
	L"Enemy jeeps and tanks can move around during combat, and may even try to run over your mercs. They will also destroy some obstacles by ramming them.",
	L"Zombies rise from corpses!",
	L"Arulco's deadly bloodcats can attack vulnerable town sectors at night. Civilian deaths will cause loyalty losses.",
	L"Taking advantage of open warfare, bandits can attack vulnerable town sectors. Civilian deaths will cause loyalty losses.",
	L"Requires the Zombies feature to be enabled. Zombies can swarm town sectors. Civilian deaths will cause loyalty losses.",
	L"Before you can train militia, you need willing volunteers. You will need to control both town sectors and the surrounding farmland to bolster your recruit pool.",
	L"Allows you to give commands to militia while in the tactical view. To do this, speak with any militia and a command menu will appear. Mercs wearing Extended Ears or Radio Sets can issue commands to militia that are out of line of sight.",
	L"Allows you to give sector movement commands to militia while in the strategic map. You may need to be in the same sector (unless you have a Radio Operator or someone staffing an HQ) to issue strategic movement orders.",
	L"Militia gear will not be randomly generated, but taken from the sector the militia is currently stationed in. Militia will return their gear to their sector when a new sector is loaded. Gear can be manually dropped in tactical via the 'Ctrl' + '.' menu, under 'militia inspection'. Gear can be prohibited to the militia by hovering over it in the strategic inventory and pressing 'TAB' + 'LMB'. It is up to you to sufficiently distribute gear to your militia.",
	L"In order to be trained, militia require 3 resources: Guns, Armour, and Misc. These can be obtained by converting dropped items in the strategic item view, and ALT + Right clicking on an item. Green Militia just require a Gun, Veteran Militia require a Gun + Armour, and Elite Militia require Gun + Armour + Misc.",
	L"General improvements to the close combat system. Head strikes deal more damage, but are harder to hit. Leg strikes are easier to land, but do less damage. Damage increased to surprised and prone targets. Stealing all items is possible on a knocked-down victim. Several other minor tweaks.",
	L"The Improved Interrupt System (IIS) completely changes how the game determines whether an interrupt occurs. Instead of interrupting as soon as a hostile enters line of sight, the game tracks several variables to simulate a soldier's ability to react and gain an interrupt.",
	L"Weapon barrels heat up as you fire them, potentially opening the door for jams, misfires, and faster weapon degradation. Weapons with replaceable barrels will probably be very useful to keep things cool.",
	L"Toggle rain in tactical. Rain will slightly decrease overall visibility and make it harder to hear things.",
	L"Toggle lightning and thunderstorms during rain. Lightning can reveal soldier positions for both you and the enemy. Thunder makes it significantly harder to hear, and overall breath regeneration is somewhat lowered.",
	L"Toggle sandstorms. Fighting in a sandstorm applies noticable maluses to all combatants - vision and hearing ranges are reduced, weapon degradation is significantly increased, and it is much harder to regain breath.",
	L"Toggle snow. In a snowstorm, it is harder to see, weapons degrade faster, and it is a little harder to regain breath.",
	L"During the course of a campaign, brief events can pop up. You can select one of two responses, which may have positive and/or negative effects. Events can affect a wide variety of things, but mostly your mercs.",
	L"After completing the food delivery quest for the rebels, they will grant you access to their command website (A.R.C.). You can set the rebels' country-wide directive there, and capturing towns allows you to enact policies in that region that provide powerful bonuses. This comes at a price - town loyalty will rise slower, so you will need to work harder to have the locals trust you.",

	L"WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.",
	L"It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends.",
	L"In the 21st century, health is a shared responsibility, involving equitable access to essential care and collective defence against transnational threats.",

	L"The small country of Arulco is currently experiencing an outbreak of the deadly arulcan plague.",
	L"Due to the catastrophic state of the state's health system, only the armies' medical corps is there to combat the deadly disease.",
	L"With the country being off limits to UN affiliates, all we can currently do is provide detailed maps on the current status of infection in Arulco. Due to the difficulty in dealing with Arulco, we regret to have to ask for a daily fee of %d$ for anyone wishing to obtain these maps.",
	L"Do you wish to acquire detailed data on the current status of disease in Arulco? You can access this data on the strategic map once acquired.",
	L"You currently do not have access to WHO data on the arulcan plague.",

	L"The arulcan plague is a deadly strain of the plague unique to the small country of Arulco. In a typical outbreak, the first victims get infected by a mosquito in a swamp or tropical sector. These first victims then inadvertently infect the population of nearby cities.",
	L"You won't immediately notice when you are infected - it might take days for the symptoms to show.",
	L"You can see the current effects of known diseases your mercs suffer from by hovering over their portrait in the strategic map.",
	L"Most diseases get worse over time, be sure to assign a doctor as soon as possible.",
	L"Some diseases can be treated with special medicine. You might find some in a well-equipped drugstore.",
	L"Doctors can be ordered to check on all local teammates for diseases. You can find out about a disease before it breaks out!",
	L"Doctors have a much higher chance to be infected when treating infected patients. Protective gear is very useful.",
	L"If a blade weapon hits an infected person, the blade becomes infected, and can be used to spread the infection further.",
