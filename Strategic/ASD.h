/** Flugente: Arulco special division decision code
 *
 *	As I do not want to alter the current strategic AI (fragile and obscure as it is), 
 *	I am leaving the control over a number of new toys to a second 'AI' - the 'Arulco Special Division'.
 *	This should control if, how and when new features are used by the AI.
 *	
 *	It has its own 'budget', which allows it to purchase new actions. This serves to limit the amount of the AIs actions.
 *	It also gives the player a way to compete with the AI - lower the AI budget, and the AI can do less harm.
 *	For example, part of the AI budget might come from mine income, which the player can take away.
 *	
 *	If possible, the AI should have to buy and maintain its assets. 
 *	This way the player could harm the AI by specifically targetting those assets if he chooses so.
 *	Ideally this gives the player another immersive way to do sth. in the game.
 *	For example, enemy helicopters have to be bought, fuelled and repaired.
 *	In order to stop enemy heli raids, the player could 
 *	  - shoot them down
 *	  - steal enemy fuel deliveries
 *	  - sabotage enemy helis in their airfield
 *	
 *	There is a cyclic update of this AI. Each time the AI decides whether it wants (and can afford) new assets.
 *	These assets then have to be ordered and can only be used once arrived.
 *	The AI also decides how to use these assets.
