	/// \brief Starts the network threads, opens the listen port.
	/// You must call this before calling Connect().
	/// Multiple calls while already active are ignored.  To call this function again with different settings, you must first call Shutdown().
	/// \note Call SetMaximumIncomingConnections if you want to accept incoming connections
	/// \note Set _RAKNET_THREADSAFE in RakNetDefines.h if you want to call RakNet functions from multiple threads (not recommended, as it is much slower and RakNet is already asynchronous).
	/// \param[in] maxConnections The maximum number of connections between this instance of RakPeer and another instance of RakPeer. Required so the network can preallocate and for thread safety. A pure client would set this to 1.  A pure server would set it to the number of allowed clients.- A hybrid would set it to the sum of both types of connections
	/// \param[in] localPort The port to listen for connections on.
	/// \param[in] _threadSleepTimer How many ms to Sleep each internal update cycle (30 to give the game priority, 0 for regular (recommended)
	/// \param[in] socketDescriptors An array of SocketDescriptor structures to force RakNet to listen on a particular IP address or port (or both).  Each SocketDescriptor will represent one unique socket.  Do not pass redundant structures.  To listen on a specific port, you can pass SocketDescriptor(myPort,0); such as for a server.  For a client, it is usually OK to just pass SocketDescriptor();
	/// \param[in] socketDescriptorCount The size of the \a socketDescriptors array.  Pass 1 if you are not sure what to pass.
	/// \return False on failure (can't create socket or thread), true on success.
